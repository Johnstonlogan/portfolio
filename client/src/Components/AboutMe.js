            Greetings, my name is Logan. I am a Developer living in San Diego,
            California. After spending some time in the US Navy, I realized my
            passion for troubleshooting. After leaving the Navy I attended a
            coding bootcamp which only furthered my passion for solving problems
            but now I was creating technology that could solve problems for so
            many people too. This feeling of creating new applications out of
            nothing but an idea brought me immeasurable joy and I canâ€™t wait to
            do more
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Please see the projects I've been working on below. Feel free to
            reach out for a chat, collaboration idea or if you feel I would be a
            good fit for your team. Thank you for checking me out!
          </p>
