            coding bootcamp which only furthered my passion for solving problems
            but now I was creating technology that could solve problems for so
            many people too. This feeling of creating new applications out of
            nothing but an idea brought me immeasurable joy and I canâ€™t wait to
            do more. `,

            had my shipmates try them out, I even programmed a D&D campaign with a built-in
             dice function. Once I decided it was my time to leave the navy, I knew I wanted
              to do something as a developer. This led me to Antioch University who was

               me to learn the basics of web development at a fast pace. `,
